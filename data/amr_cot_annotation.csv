Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs represent an election event.
- Both AMRs mention the Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council.
- Both AMRs mention the date of the election as 6 May 1999.
- Both AMRs mention the location of the election as Greater Manchester, England.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, the purpose of the election is represented by the government organization ""Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council"" and the members being elected are mentioned separately. In AMR 2, the purpose of the election is represented by the members being elected and the government organization ""Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council"" is mentioned separately.
- In AMR 1, the location of the election is represented by the local region ""Oldham Council"" and the city ""Greater Manchester"" is mentioned as part of the country ""England"". In AMR 2, the location of the election is represented by the city ""Greater Manchester"" and the country ""England"" is mentioned separately.

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs involve the inclusion of two individuals, Stafford Henry Northcote and his nephew, William Henry Waddington.
- Both AMRs mention the French minister.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, Stafford Henry Northcote is mentioned first, followed by his nephew, William Henry Waddington. In AMR 2, the order is reversed.
- In AMR 1, the French minister is mentioned as a separate entity, while in AMR 2, the French minister is mentioned as a modifier of William Henry Waddington.

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of describing a church or nave with three bays, a transept related to side walls, and a chevet ending in three polygonal apses, there are significant differences in the specific details mentioned. The use of different adjectives to describe the nave and chevet, as well as the absence of the ""absurd"" information in AMR 2, indicate that the sentences have different meanings.

Answer: No

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities, there are significant differences in the AMRs. The main difference lies in the representation of the location and domain of the party. In AMR 1, the location is specified as ""French Dahomey"", while in AMR 2, it is simply mentioned as ""Dahomey"".

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs involve the release/publishing of four children's albums.
- Both AMRs mention the name ""Gwendolyn"" and the phrase ""Gwendolyn and the"" in relation to the albums.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- AMR 1 involves the organization ""Good Time Gang"" releasing the albums, while AMR 2 involves the person ""Gwendolyn"" publishing the albums.
- In AMR 1, the organization name ""Good Time Gang"" is mentioned, while in AMR 2, the phrase ""Good Time Gang"" is mentioned as part of the album name.
- The order of the words in the album name differs between the two AMRs.

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs mention the United States Census Bureau.
- Both AMRs mention Milton Township.
- Both AMRs mention a total area.
- Both AMRs mention land and water.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, the total area is described as ""a total area of, of which has land and, or 1.00%, is water."" In AMR 2, the total area is described as ""a total area of which is land and, or 1.00%, water is.""
- In AMR 1, the relationship between Milton Township and the total area is described as ""include-91"" (Milton Township includes the total area). In AMR 2, the relationship is described as ""part-of"" (the total area is part of Milton Township).
- The structure of the AMRs is different, with different argument roles and order of elements.

Based on these differences, it can be concluded that the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. The differences in the structure and the way the information is presented indicate that there are subtle differences in meaning between the two sentences.",0,7,0,0,0,1,1,1

Use the following format: Answer: [Yes/No]","Answer: No

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs represent the location of Knavesmire Primary School.
- Both AMRs mention Knavesmire Road and Campleshon Road.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, the school is located ""on the southern end of Campleshon Road"", while in AMR 2, the school is located ""at the southern end of Campleshon Road"".
- In AMR 1, the school is located ""on"" Knavesmire Road, while in AMR 2, the school is located ""in"" Knavesmire Road.

Based on these differences, it can be concluded that the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. The use of ""on"" versus ""in"" to describe the location of the school on Knavesmire Road and the use of ""at"" versus ""on"" to describe the location of the school at the southern end of Campleshon Road indicate subtle differences in the spatial relationships between the two sentences.",0,4,0,0,1,1,1,1

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share commonalities in terms of the location names and the fact that they are former municipalities, there are differences in the type of location mentioned (town vs. city) and the order of some elements in the AMRs.

Use the following format: Answer: [Yes/No]","Answer: No

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs represent a win event (win-01) with the same arguments: ARG0 (players), ARG2 (final), ARG4 (opposing players), and rel (score).
- Both AMRs have the same players involved in the win event: Henri Kontinen, Frederik Nielsen, Jordan Kerr, and Ken Skupski.
- Both AMRs mention the same final.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, the manner of the win event is represented by the AMR node (a3 / and~18 :op1 2~17 :op2 6~19 :op3 4~21), indicating that the win was with a score of 6-2, 6-4.
- In AMR 2, the manner of the win event is represented by the AMR node (s / score-entity~16 :op2 2~16 :value 6~14) and (s2 / score-entity~20 :value 6~18 :value 4~20), indicating that the win was with a score of 6-2 and 6-4.

Based on the differences in the representation of the manner of the win event, it can be concluded that the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs involve the same person, Tinnish, who performs the action of announcing.
- Both AMRs mention the cities Atlanta and Toronto.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- The order of the cities in the announcement is different. In AMR 1, Tinnish announces his withdrawal from Atlanta and his decision to remain in Toronto. In AMR 2, Tinnish announces his withdrawal from Toronto and his decision to remain in Atlanta.
- The date format is different. In AMR 1, the date is represented as ""1 December"" while in AMR 2, it is represented as ""December 1"".

- Both AMRs include the year ""1870"" (d / date-entity~1) as a time reference.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- The order of the arguments and their corresponding roles is different in the two AMRs. For example, in AMR 1, Fintan Mundwiler is mentioned as an abbot (a2 / abbot~12), while in AMR 2, Martin Marty is mentioned as an abbot (a2 / abbot~12).

Use the following format: Answer: [Yes/No]","Answer: No

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs involve the action of writing a song.
- Both AMRs mention the song ""The Envoy"" and its album of the same name.
- Both AMRs mention the year 1982.
- Both AMRs involve honoring someone.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, Warren Zevon is the one who wrote the song, while in AMR 2, Habib is the one who wrote the song.
- In AMR 1, the song is written in honor of Habib, while in AMR 2, the song is written in honor of Warren Zevon.
- The structure and organization of the AMRs are different.

Based on the differences in the AMRs, it can be concluded that the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. The differences in the subject of the action, the recipient of the honor, and the overall structure of the sentences indicate that there are variations in the meaning conveyed by the sentences.",0,,,,,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!

- Both AMRs mention that the attempt/supply/provision is related to Italy.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, the attempt is described as supplying the oasis by land, while in AMR 2, the attempt is described as providing the oasis following the defeat and withdrawal by land.
- In AMR 1, the attempt is represented as an argument of the ""supply"" predicate, while in AMR 2, the attempt is represented as an argument of the ""provide"" predicate.
- In AMR 1, the withdrawal is represented as an argument of the ""withdraw"" predicate, while in AMR 2, the withdrawal is represented as an argument of the ""follow"" predicate.

Use the following format: Answer: [Yes/No]","Answer: No

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs have the same root node ""be-located-at-91~1"" indicating the location relationship.
- Both AMRs mention ""Belhanhumei"" as the location.
- Both AMRs mention ""Somalia"" as the country.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- Sentence 1's AMR represents ""Belhanhumei"" as a town, while Sentence 2's AMR represents it as a city.
- Sentence 1's AMR represents ""Hiran"" as a region, while Sentence 2's AMR represents it as a modifier of ""Somalia"".

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases because they differ in the representation of ""Belhanhumei"" (town vs. city) and the representation of ""Hiran"" (region vs. modifier).

Use the following format: Answer: [Yes/No]","Answer: No

Explanation: 

The commonalities between the two AMRs are as follows:
- Both AMRs have the same structure and contain the same set of concepts.
- Both AMRs represent the actions of Ben connecting with Norman and becoming close friends after a sleepover.
- Both AMRs include the ""and"" operator to connect the actions of Ben starting/beginning to connect with Norman and them becoming close friends.

The differences between the two AMRs are as follows:
- In AMR 1, the action of Ben connecting with Norman is represented by the ""begin-01"" concept, while in AMR 2, it is represented by the ""start-01"" concept.
- In AMR 1, the person concept representing Ben is connected to the connect action concept, while in AMR 2, the person concept representing Ben is connected to the start action concept.
- In AMR 1, the person concept representing Norman is connected to the connect action concept, while in AMR 2, the person concept representing Norman is connected to the start action concept.

Based on these differences, it can be concluded that the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. While they convey a similar meaning, the specific actions of Ben (beginning vs. starting) and the connections between the person concepts and action concepts differ between the two sentences.",0,,,,,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, the first argument is represented by the ""live-01"" concept, while in AMR 2, it is represented by the ""reside-01"" concept.

Answer: Yes

Explanation: The two sentences are exact paraphrases of each other because they have the same meaning. The only difference between the sentences is the use of the words ""lived"" and ""resided"" to describe Butler's presence at Washington Square Park. However, both words convey the same idea of Butler being in a particular location. Therefore, the sentences can be considered paraphrases.",1,,,,,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs represent a win event (win-01) with the same arguments and roles.
- Both AMRs have the same final event (final) with the same modifiers (and) and values (7-6, 7-6).
- Both AMRs have the same person entities (person) with the same names (Brenda Schultz, Helena Suková).

Differences between the two AMRs:
- The names of the persons involved in the win event are swapped between the two AMRs.
- The order of the names in the person entities is different between the two AMRs.

Based on these differences, it can be concluded that the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.

Use the following format: Answer: [Yes/No]","Answer: Yes

Explanation: The commonalities between the two AMRs are as follows:
- Both AMRs have the same structure, starting with an ""and"" operator (a / and~10 :op1 ...) that connects two sub-AMRs.
- Both AMRs have two sub-AMRs connected by the ""and"" operator.
- Both sub-AMRs have the same structure, starting with a verb (construct-01~2 :ARG0 ...) or (design-01~11 :ARG0 ...), followed by the person's name and other arguments.

The differences between the two AMRs are as follows:
- The order of the sub-AMRs is reversed in AMR 1 compared to AMR 2.
- The roles of the verbs ""construct"" and ""design"" are interchanged in AMR 1 compared to AMR 2.

Despite these differences, the two sentences convey the same meaning. Both sentences describe the process of constructing and designing something, with the involvement of a local engineer named Joseph H. Howe and a local builder named Martin Johnson. The differences in word order and verb roles do not change the overall meaning of the sentences.

Explanation: 

Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs represent a village in Mafraq, located in western Saudi Arabia.
- Both AMRs mention the name ""Al Madinah"" and its association with a province.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- AMR 1 represents the province of Al-Madinah as a domain of the village, while AMR 2 represents Al Madinah Province as a domain of the village.
- AMR 1 represents the name ""Al Madinah"" as a separate entity with two parts (""Al"" and ""Madinah""), while AMR 2 represents it as a single entity with three parts (""Al"", ""Madinah"", and ""Province"").

Based on these differences, it can be concluded that the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.

Use the following format: Answer: [Yes/No]","Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs represent a person named Kurt Treu who was a German classical philologist.
- Both AMRs mention the birth date of Kurt Treu as 15 September 1928.
- Both AMRs mention the death date of Kurt Treu as 6 June 1991.
- Both AMRs mention the locations of Kurt Treu's birth and death, with one sentence mentioning Karja, Saare County, Estonia, and the other mentioning Vienna, Austria.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- The order of the birth and death locations is reversed in the two AMRs.
- The structure of the location representation differs slightly, with one AMR using a nested structure (city -> county -> country) and the other using a flat structure (city -> country).
- The order of the birth and death dates is reversed in the two AMRs.

Answer: Yes

Explanation: The two sentences are exact paraphrases of each other. Although there are some differences in the structure and order of the AMRs, the overall meaning conveyed by both sentences is the same. They both provide information about Kurt Treu, his occupation, birth date, death date, and birth and death locations. The differences in the AMRs can be attributed to variations in representation style or minor differences in the way the information is structured, but they do not change the overall meaning of the sentences.",1,,,,,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!

- AMR 1 explicitly mentions that the yellow stripe is on the median legs, while AMR 2 mentions that the stripe is associated with a ""thing"" (t3) which is related to the legs.

Answer: Yes

The two sentences are paraphrases of each other because they convey the same meaning with slight variations in the way the information is structured. Both sentences describe the legs as having brown color and a thin, long, yellow stripe. The differences in the AMRs can be attributed to variations in sentence structure and the way the information is represented in the AMR format.",1,,,,,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share many commonalities in their AMRs, there are some differences. In AMR 1, there is an additional node ""a2"" representing the conjunction ""and"" in the ARG2 of ""m"". Additionally, AMR 1 has the node ""k3"" representing the noun ""key-02"" in the ARG2 of ""r2"", which is not present in AMR 2.
