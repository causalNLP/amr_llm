Explanation: While both sentences express the idea that the USDA and the NAACP should have verified the story before taking action against Ms Sherrod, there is a difference in the way her situation is described.

Explanation: While the overall meaning of the sentences is similar, there is a slight difference in the words used. In Sentence 1, the phrase ""pissed him off"" is used to describe the people who the person decided to kill. In Sentence 2, the phrase ""angered or annoyed him"" is used instead. Although the two phrases have similar meanings, they are not exact synonyms, which suggests that the sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.","No

Explanation: While both sentences share similar structures and convey a negative sentiment towards making idiotic comments, there are some differences in the wording and phrasing. Sentence 1 uses the phrase ""froth over"" to describe Willow's reaction, while Sentence 2 uses the phrase ""bubble up and spill over the edge of a container."" Additionally, Sentence 2 includes the additional detail of the comments spilling over the edge of a container. These differences suggest that the sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.","No
