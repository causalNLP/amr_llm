Differences between the two AMRs:
- AMR 1 has the thread relation (t4) as the location of the lose-03 relation, while AMR 2 has the discussion relation (d) as the location of the lose-03 relation.

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because there is a difference in the location mentioned in the AMRs. Sentence 1 mentions ""thread"" as the location, while Sentence 2 mentions ""discussion"" as the location. This difference in location indicates a difference in the context and therefore the meaning of the sentences.","No

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share many commonalities in terms of the predicate, arguments, and structure, there is a difference in the modifier used to indicate the amount of payment. In AMR 1, the modifier ""more:quant(lot(hell))"" suggests a larger amount, while in AMR 2, the modifier ""more:quant(considerable)"" suggests a significant amount. Therefore, the two sentences have a slightly different meaning.","No

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because they have a slight difference in meaning. While both sentences convey the idea that the troops and civilian employees/contractors are paid significantly more than other countries, the use of ""hell"" in AMR 1 and ""inferno"" in AMR 2 suggests a difference in the intensity or degree of the payment.

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although the overall structure and most of the AMR nodes are the same, the difference in labeling the ARG2 node from ""boob"" to ""breast"" changes the meaning of the sentence.

- Both AMRs have the same argument structure for the main predicate, with the government as the entity being saved (""government-organization"").
- Both AMRs have a time argument indicating when the saving action takes place.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- AMR 1 has a time argument ""fall-07"" with ""bottom"" as its ARG1 and ""out-06"" as its ARG2.
- AMR 2 has a time argument ""when"" with ""drop-01"" as its op1, which has ""bottom"" as its ARG1, ""physical"" as its manner, and ""out-06"" as its ARG2.

Answer: No
The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the main predicate and the argument structure, there are differences in the time argument. In AMR 1, the time argument is represented as the falling out of the bottom, while in AMR 2, the time argument is represented as the physical dropping out of the bottom. These differences suggest that the two sentences have slightly different meanings.","No

Although they share some commonalities in terms of the recommendation to verify the story and the involvement of the USDA, NAACP, and Ms Sherrod, the specific consequences of jumping the gun differ. In Sentence 1, Ms Sherrod is thrown under the bus, while in Sentence 2, she is unfairly blamed. These differences in the consequences indicate a difference in meaning between the two sentences.","No

Answer: No
The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the overall structure and the presence of certain nodes, there are significant differences in the AMRs. The use of ""lock"" in AMR 1 and ""sure thing"" in AMR 2 conveys a different level of certainty. Additionally, the presence of a beneficiary node in AMR 1 suggests a different relationship between the general and Obama compared to AMR 2. These differences indicate that the sentences have different meanings and are not exact paraphrases.","No

Answer: No

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share many similarities in terms of the recommended actions and the entities being helped, there are some differences in the specific actions mentioned. In Sentence 1, there is a mention of hanging around like with Katrina giving out money, while in Sentence 2, there is a mention of hanging around like with a woman named Katrina giving out money. These differences suggest that the two sentences have slightly different meanings and are not exact paraphrases.","No

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because they have different arguments in the ""stick-01"" predicate. Sentence 1 uses the word ""cretins"" while Sentence 2 uses the word ""idiots"". Although the overall structure and meaning of the sentences are similar, the specific choice of words makes them different.","No

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the overall structure and the use of the ""stick-01"" predicate, there are significant differences in the specific groups of people being referred to and the modifiers used. Additionally, the representation of the high capacity for learning differs between the two sentences.

Answer: No
The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the main predicate and the possession, the differences in the ARG1s indicate different actions and entities involved. In Sentence 1, there is a mention of a death panel, while in Sentence 2, there is a mention of a group deciding who gets healthcare.

Answer: Yes
Explanation: The two sentences are exact paraphrases of each other. Both sentences describe Mr Blair standing in a location while the village idiot arrives with a basket of rotten fruit. The only difference is the description of the location, where in Sentence 1 it is described as ""in the stocks"" and in Sentence 2 it is described as ""in a medieval punishment device"".

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although there are some commonalities in the AMRs, there are also significant differences. In AMR 1, the concept of ""opening mouth and inserting foot"" is mentioned, while in AMR 2, the concept of ""making a foolish statement"" is mentioned. Additionally, the ARG1 relations between ""right-06"" and ""it"" are different in both AMRs.

In AMR 1, the concept of ""opening mouth and inserting foot"" is mentioned, while in AMR 2, the concept of ""making a foolish statement"" is mentioned. Additionally, the ARG1 relations between ""right-06"" and ""it"" are different in both AMRs.

- Both AMRs have the same example structure with the verb ""hear-01"" and its arguments.

Differences between the two AMRs:

- In AMR 1, the country is modified by ""this"", while in AMR 2, it is modified by ""this"" and ""finance-01"".
- In AMR 1, the pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to the people wondering about the debt, while in AMR 2, the pronoun ""we"" is used.

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in their AMRs, there are significant differences in the verbs used to describe exploiting the country, the modifiers of the country, and the pronouns used to refer to the people wondering about the debt. These differences indicate that the sentences have different meanings and are not simply rewritten versions of each other.","No

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because there are differences in the AMRs. While most of the AMR structure and arguments are the same, there are differences in the second and eighth arguments. In AMR 1, the second argument indicates ""sponging off"" the country, while in AMR 2, the second argument indicates ""cleaning with"" the country. Additionally, in AMR 1, the eighth argument is a ""wonder"" relation with the ""thing"" as its argument, while in AMR 2, the eighth argument is a ""wonder"" relation with the ""thing"" as its argument. These differences suggest that the sentences have slightly different meanings.","No

Answer: No

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the structure and the presence of contrast, the specific actions and meanings associated with the interpretation differ. In Sentence 1, the interpretation is related to urinating, while in Sentence 2, the interpretation is related to extreme fear. Therefore, the sentences have different meanings and cannot be considered exact paraphrases.","No

Answer: Yes

The two sentences are exact paraphrases of each other. Both sentences have the same structure and convey the same meaning, with the only difference being the choice of words used to describe the act of urination (pee vs. urinate) and the clothing item (pants vs. trousers). However, these differences do not change the overall meaning of the sentences, as they both express the idea of interpreting someone's statement as indicating that they would urinate in their clothing.","Yes

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in their AMRs, there are also significant differences. AMR 1 includes the concept of ""worry-01"" and its arguments, which is not present in AMR 2. Additionally, AMR 2 does not have any AMR representation, which makes it difficult to determine the exact meaning of the sentence. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be concluded that the two sentences have the same meaning.","No

In Sentence 1, the subject is looking for an ""old banger run-around,"" while in Sentence 2, the subject is looking for an ""old car for run-around."" These differences in entities indicate a difference in meaning, as a ""banger"" and a ""car"" are not necessarily the same thing.","No

The differences between the two AMRs are as follows:
- In AMR 1, the banger is an ARG1-of the run-08 relation, indicating it is being used as a run-around vehicle. In AMR 2, the banger is an ARG1-of the chase-01 relation, indicating it is being used as a chase vehicle.

Answer: No
The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share many commonalities in their AMRs, the difference in the usage of the banger (as a run-around vs. a chase vehicle) indicates a difference in the intended meaning of the sentences.","No

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because there is a difference in the AMRs. While both sentences have similar structures and convey a similar meaning, the specific details of the situation differ. In Sentence 1, the subject is in the gray area, while in Sentence 2, the subject is in an uncertain situation. This difference in the AMRs suggests that there might be a slight difference in meaning between the two sentences.","No

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because there is a difference in the feeling expressed. In Sentence 1, the speaker feels like a zombie, while in Sentence 2, the speaker feels extremely tired. This difference in feeling indicates a difference in meaning between the two sentences.","No

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although the overall structure of the sentences and the AMRs is similar, there is a difference in the specific words used to describe the feeling. In Sentence 1, the speaker feels like a ""zombie"", while in Sentence 2, the speaker feels like a ""reanimated corpse"". While both phrases convey a similar idea of feeling lifeless or unenergetic, the use of different words indicates a slight difference in meaning.

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because there is a difference in the AMRs. In AMR 1, the ""guy"" is described as wearing ""shades"" (s2), while in AMR 2, the ""guy"" is described as being in ""shadows"" (sh). This difference in the description of the ""guy"" suggests a difference in the meaning of the two sentences.","No

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share similarities in terms of the argument structure and the main action of ""do-02"" related to the minimum wage and the economy, there are differences in the speaker's attitude and emphasis. In Sentence 1, the speaker expresses indifference with the phrase ""I don't actually give two figs,"" while in Sentence 2, the speaker emphasizes their lack of concern with the phrase ""I don't actually care at all.""

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the main predicate, ARG0, ARG2, ARG3, ARG4, and location, there are differences in the options provided in ARG1. In AMR 1, there are options for ""they"" being good and bad, while in AMR 2, there are no additional options. This indicates a difference in meaning between the two sentences.","No

",,"Commonalities between the two AMRs:
- Both AMRs have the same root node ""p"" representing the verb ""possible-01"" with a negative polarity.
- Both AMRs have the same structure with nested arguments and modifiers.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- AMR 1 includes the specific information about buying ""tripe"" and the condition of Iraq becoming something if the dictator is removed.
- AMR 2 replaces the specific information about buying ""tripe"" with ""stomach lining of a cow"".

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in the AMR structure, the specific information about buying ""tripe"" in AMR 1 is replaced with ""stomach lining of a cow"" in AMR 2. This change in specific details alters the meaning of the sentences, making them not exact paraphrases.","No

Additionally, the ARG1 node in AMR 2 has a unit ""year"" specified by the ARG1 node ""temporal-quantity"".

Answer: Yes
The two sentences are exact paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same meaning that making him do a 20 year action would have the desired deterrent effect. The differences in the AMRs are minor and do not change the overall meaning of the sentences. The change from ""stretch"" to ""prison sentence"" in AMR 2 is a synonym substitution, and the addition of the modifier ""prison"" provides more specific information about the type of sentence. The presence of the same root node and the same ARG0, ARG1, ARG2, and ARG1-of nodes in both AMRs further support the conclusion that the sentences are paraphrases.","Yes

Answer: Yes

Explanation: The two sentences are exact paraphrases of each other because they have the same abstract meaning representation (AMR) structure, with the only difference being the choice of words used to express the same meaning. Both sentences convey the idea that making someone do a 20-year action (either ""stretch"" or ""elongation"") would have the desired deterrent effect.","Yes

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because the AMRs representing the sentences have a difference in meaning. In Sentence 1, the person is described as being killed by the nutter when they piss him off. In Sentence 2, the person is described as being killed by the nutter when they anger or annoy him. The use of ""piss off"" in Sentence 1 and ""anger or annoy"" in Sentence 2 indicates a difference in the specific actions that trigger the nutter's decision to kill.

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in their AMRs, the difference in the topic nodes indicates a difference in the specific entities being referred to. Sentence 1 talks about ""nutters"" while Sentence 2 talks about ""crazy people.""

Answer: No

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because they have different descriptions of what is being shoved down our throats.

- Both AMRs include a complete rejection (ARG1-of reject-01) of something (ARG1) being shoved down (ARG1-of shove-01) our throats (op1 of throat).

The differences between the two AMRs are:
- In AMR 1, the rejected thing is described as ""piles of dung"" (ARG1 of pile-01), while in AMR 2, it is described as ""policies"" (ARG1 of policy).
- In AMR 1, the rejected thing is being shoved down ""our"" throats (ARG2 of shove-01), while in AMR 2, it is being forcefully imposed on ""us"" (ARG2 of impose-01).

Answer: No

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the win, the direct smack down, and the rejection, there are significant differences in the specific objects being rejected and the manner in which they are imposed. In Sentence 1, the rejected objects are described as ""piles of dung"" and are being shoved down ""our"" throats, while in Sentence 2, the rejected objects are ""policies"" and are being forcefully imposed on ""us"". These differences indicate that the two sentences have different meanings and are not paraphrases of each other.","No

- Both AMRs have the same ARG0 argument representing the person ""Brown"" who won.
- Both AMRs have the same ARG0-of argument representing the representation of the win event.

Differences between the two AMRs:

- In AMR 1, the destination of the smack down action is represented as ""down"", while in AMR 2, the destination is represented as ""into our mouths"".

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share many commonalities in terms of the event and the arguments, there are differences in the specific verbs used and the representation of the destination of the smack down action.

- Both AMRs involve a direct action (represent-01) by the win towards a government organization (ARG1).
- Both AMRs include a complete rejection (reject-01) of piles of dung being shoved down our throats (ARG1).

Differences between the two AMRs:
- In AMR 1, the win is described as a ""smack down"" (smack-02), while in AMR 2, it is described as a ""physical blow"" (blow-01).
- In AMR 1, the direct action is towards the government organization, while in AMR 2, it is towards the government organization with the instrument of a physical blow.
- The specific AMR nodes and relations used to represent the same meaning differ slightly between the two AMRs.

Answer: No
The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. While they share some commonalities in terms of the win, the rejection, and the involvement of the government organization, there are significant differences in the specific actions and descriptions used. In AMR 1, the win is described as a ""direct smack down,"" while in AMR 2, it is described as a ""direct physical blow."" These differences in wording and the specific actions used indicate that the sentences have different meanings and are not exact paraphrases of each other.","No

Answer: No

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.

In sentence 1, the vote is cast with one's feet, while in sentence 2, the vote is cast by choosing to stay away.

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because there is a difference in the AMRs. In AMR 1, the speaker casts their ""vote"" concerning the Church with their feet, while in AMR 2, the speaker casts their ""vote"" concerning the Church using their feet. The difference lies in the manner in which the vote is cast, with ""with"" in AMR 1 and ""using"" in AMR 2. Although the overall meaning is similar, this difference in the AMRs indicates a difference in the specific action being described, making the sentences not exact paraphrases.","No

Answer: No

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some similarities in terms of the overall structure and the action of running out of prison space, there are significant differences in the specific details. AMR 1 focuses on scoring political points with grandstanding about ASBO's and law and order, while AMR 2 specifies that the points are political and the grandstanding is about ASBO's and the enforcement of laws and maintenance of public safety. These differences indicate that the sentences have different meanings and are not simply rewritten versions of each other.","No

- Both AMRs have the same ARG0 node representing the subject of the verb, which is a slash node with two children: a pirate node and a cartel node.
- Both AMRs have the same ARG1 node representing the direct object of the verb, which is an ""i"" node representing the pronoun ""me"".

Differences between the two AMRs:
- AMR 2 has an additional degree node ""extreme"" attached to the root node ""bore-02"", indicating the intensity of the verb.

Answer: No
Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share commonalities in terms of the verb, subject, and direct object, the presence of the degree node ""extreme"" in AMR 2 introduces a difference in meaning. Sentence 2 suggests a higher level of intensity or extremity in the boredom compared to Sentence 1. Therefore, the two sentences do not have the same meaning and cannot be considered exact paraphrases.","No

Answer: No

The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. While they share some commonalities in terms of the actions and entities involved, the specific actions and effects on the speaker are different. In AMR 1, the speaker would be bored, while in AMR 2, a hole would be drilled through the speaker.

Differences between the two AMRs:
- AMR 1 has the ""bomb"" concept as the manner-of of the ""way"" concept, while AMR 2 has the ""detonate"" concept as the manner-of of the ""way"" concept.

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other because the AMRs representing the sentences have a difference in the manner-of concept of the ""way"" concept. In Sentence 1, the plan is described as ""bombing out,"" while in Sentence 2, the plan is described as ""detonating."" Although both concepts involve an explosive action, the specific words used to describe the action differ, indicating a difference in meaning between the two sentences.","No

Differences between the two AMRs:

Answer: Yes

Explanation: The two sentences are exact paraphrases of each other. The only difference between the two sentences is the presence of the phrase ""jack and shit"" in Sentence 1, which is represented by the additional mod relation in AMR 1. However, this phrase does not change the overall meaning of the sentence. Both sentences convey the same message, which is blaming anesthesia for Perry's lack of knowledge about foreign policy. Therefore, the sentences are paraphrases of each other.","Yes

Answer: No

Explanation: The two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other. Although they share some commonalities in terms of the overall structure and some nodes, there is a significant difference in the ARG1 node of the ""knowing"" action. In AMR 1, it mentions ""jack and shit about foreign policy"", while in AMR 2, it mentions ""a man named Jack and feces about foreign policy"".
